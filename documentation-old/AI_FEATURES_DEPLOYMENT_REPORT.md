## 🎯 Features in Action

### Feature 1: Predictive Grade Analytics
```
Input: Student ID, historical grades
Process: Polynomial regression on grade history
Output: Predicted final grade, confidence, trend, recommendations
Example: "Predicted: 78% (High confidence) - Improving trend - Focus on Math"
```

### Feature 2: Dropout Risk Detection
```
Input: Student attendance, grades, fees
Calculation: Weighted scoring (40% + 30% + 30%)
Output: Risk score 0-100, risk level (High/Medium/Low)
Example: Score 72 = HIGH RISK → Immediate intervention needed
```

### Feature 3: Behavioral Anomalies
```
Input: Grade history, attendance patterns
Detection: Grade drops >15pts OR attendance changes >30%
Output: Anomaly type, severity, description
Example: "Sudden Grade Drop (High) - Grades fell 18 points"
```

### Feature 4: Study Recommendations
```
Input: Student average grade
Process: Rule-based recommendation engine
Output: Study focus areas, time allocation, specific actions
Example: "Grade 65 - Focus Math 3hrs/week, Science 2hrs/week"
```

### Feature 5: Attendance Analytics
```
Input: Attendance records
Analysis: Daily patterns, seasonal trends, chronic absenteeism
Output: Pattern summary, worst day, seasonal trends
Example: "Worst day: Monday (78%) | Jan-March trend: +12%"
```

### Feature 6: Financial Intelligence
```
Input: Fee records, payment history
Calculation: Default risk + health score
Output: Risk score, financial health, payment plans
Example: "High Default Risk (72) - Recommend 3-month payment plan"
```

### Feature 7: Teacher Performance
```
Input: Student grades by teacher
Calculation: Grade aggregation + effectiveness formula
Output: Effectiveness score, rating, recommendations
Example: "Score 84 (Good) - Recommend professional development"
```

### Feature 8: Student Clustering
```
Input: Grades, attendance
Algorithm: K-Means clustering (k=3)
Output: Segments (High Performers, Average, At Risk)
Example: "High Performers: 15 students | Average: 42 | At Risk: 8"
```

### Feature 9: NLP Feedback
```
Input: Performance data, recommendations, anomalies
Process: Template-based NLP with dynamic insertion
Output: Professional feedback comments
Example: Auto-generated parent message with personalized insights
```

### Feature 10: Enrollment Forecasting
```
Input: Monthly enrollment history
Algorithm: Linear regression on time series
Output: 3-month forecast, resource recommendations
